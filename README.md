# 🌐 Knowledge Graphs – Semantic Data Management Project

## 🧠 Abstract

This project explores the construction and querying of a **Knowledge Graph** using **RDFLib** and **SPARQL**. The focus lies on semantic data representation, leveraging RDF Schema (RDFS) to model and instantiate an ontology that supports advanced SPARQL queries and reasoning via inference.

## 🏗️ Ontology Structure

The ontology is defined under the namespace: `http://SDM.org/Lab2/`.

### 🔷 TBOX (Schema)
- Implemented using **RDFLib** with **RDFS**.
- Defines classes and properties, including domain/range restrictions using `xsd` datatypes.
- Subclass relationships are used to infer additional types.
- Inference regime: **RDFS (Optimized)**.

### 🟤 ABOX (Instances)
- Populated using CSV files:
  - Node attributes → literals (e.g., author names, paper titles)
  - Object properties → relationships (e.g., `writes`, `cites`)
- Unique URIs generated by combining class name with row number.
- Review data modeled to reflect relationships between `reviewer`, `review`, and `paper`.

## 📊 Dataset Summary

| **Entity**       | **Count** |
|------------------|-----------|
| Papers           | 7,985     |
| Authors          | 2,916     |
| Volumes          | 814       |
| Journals         | 20        |

| Compilations     | 844       |
| Communities      | 7         |

| **Ontology Stats**   | **Count** |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Classes              | 18        |
| Properties           | 36        |
| Total RDF Triples    | > 21,000  |

## 🔍 SPARQL Queries

Implemented queries include:

1. **List all authors**
2. **Properties with `author` as domain**
3. **Properties with `conference` or `journal` as domain**
4. **Papers by a given author in database community**
5. **Top 5 most cited papers in the database community**
6. **Top NLP conferences based on paper count and citations**

All queries use standard SPARQL prefixes and are designed to operate over both TBOX and ABOX.

## 📈 Insights & Reasoning

- **RDFS Inference** enables implicit data to be derived (e.g., subclass or subproperty relationships).
- **Taxonomies** enhance graph traversal and semantic search.
- The system avoids data duplication by distinguishing roles (e.g., `reviewer` vs `author`) via logic and inference.

## 📌 Conclusion

Knowledge Graphs provide a robust semantic framework for organizing and querying data. Their inferential capabilities and taxonomy-based structure support advanced exploration and reduce redundancy in modeling.
